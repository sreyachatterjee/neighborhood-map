Neighborhood Map(React) Project:

I have built a single page application featuring a map of popular restaurants in Wilmington, Delaware.
I have added functionality to this map including highlighted locations,
third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.


Required Installation and steps:

1. Install all project dependencies with npm install

2. npm install axios, a promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js which is similar to fetch API.

3. npm install react-burger-menu, an off-canvas sidebar React component with a collection of effects and 
    styles using CSS transitions and SVG path animations. I have used it to create the off-canvas sidebar.

4. npm install escape-string-regexp, that I have used for special characters.

5. I have used Google Maps API.

6. As a non-Google third-party API, I have used Foursquare Developers.

7. To disable an ESLint rule in a file or on a specific line, I have added a comment:
    //eslint-disable-next-line

8. Start the development server with npm start

9. Open the web app on http://localhost:3000
